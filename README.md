I am proficent in many programming langauges and tools, having had experience in roles ranging from data analytics to web application development. 

I :heart: Python for it's syntax and powerful libraries, but for web development I usually prefer a more lightwieght Java/Kotlin + Angular stack. I am also proficent in R and SAS for data analysis and machine learning.
